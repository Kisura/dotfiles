Installation without Brewfile
•LogiPresentation
•Unlox (I probably don't need this, since I now have Touch ID )

During the intallation with the ~/.dotfiles/script/bootstrap
there will be an error with vitualbox. This is normal
We have to go into System Settings -> security and privacy -> Privacy tab
There we have to allow oracle as a trusted developer.
Then run the whole thing again.


after installing xcode we have to execute the following 2 lines of code

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
and
sudo xcodebuild -license accept


And for installing Perl completely, we have to add
this to our environment

export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1

In order to function properly, we need the dropbox folder to be fully synced first. So this requires some patience.


After having everything installed, do the following

Set up all different chrome profiles

Set up all private mail accounts

Set up business mail account in outlook

Set up iCloud
•everything except Siri & Mail
•Photos -> Only shared Albums
•iCloud -> all except desktop & documents folder (this will automatically end up in a pricy subscription of iCloud)
